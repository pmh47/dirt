"""Helper functions for homogeneous transform matrices.

This module defines helper functions used to construct transform matrices.
These functions assume the matrices will *right*-multiply the vectors to be transformed, i.e.
that the inputs are row vectors -- as is the case for a matrix of vertices indexed naturally
Equivalently, matrices are indexed by *, x/y/z[/w] (in), x/y/z[/w] (out) -- where * represents any
sequence of indices, over all of which the operation is mapped
